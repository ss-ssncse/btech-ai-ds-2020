** COURSE OBJECTIVES
- To develop intuitions about quantities and relationships in general and probability and statistics specifically
- To learn the ideas of reproducible research and reporting of statistical analyses
- To critically evaluate statistical information 
- To learn graphical and modeling techniques for exploring data, with an emphasis on visualization, interpretation. 
- To learn how to use of modern software tools for data manipulation and visualization
